# dbt-saas

You can read more about how this repository works at [getvero.com/resources]().

This `dbt` project has been tested with:

- Stripe data synchronised via StitchData.
- A Redshift database on AWS.
- `dbt` running `v0.9.1`.

It outputs a nice chart like this one in [Mode Analytics]():

![Charting MRR movements with SQL](https://dha4w82d62smt.cloudfront.net/items/2C3x2J321G3B1X2M3H33/charting-mrr-movements-sql-dbt-redshift.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=385188)

Many thanks to the team at [dbt](http://getdbt.com) for a great framework. Feel free to use this in your own project or cherry pick as desired!
